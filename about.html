            My name is Byron Luke, and Iâ€™m a former Marine currently working on an intermediate capstone project with American Military University. Drawing from my military experience, I've developed the S.O.S Alert app to address the urgent need for fast, discreet communication during emergencies, particularly active shooter situations. This project is part of my commitment to public safety and my belief that technology can help save lives when it matters most. By providing individuals with a tool to quickly report threats, I hope to create safer environments in schools, malls, and other public spaces, continuing my mission to protect and serve.</p>
